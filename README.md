A proof of concept for smart contracts implemented over a blockchain framework to maintain file ownership by associating fileHashes to the owner of the file and timestamp at the time of upload.

Software Used:
  Ganache-CLI
  Truffle
  Solidity 0.5.8
  Web3js for Ethereum
  NodeJS
  NPM Package Manager
  
The fileHashes correspond to the files uploaded to an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and are obtained at the consent of the owner.
